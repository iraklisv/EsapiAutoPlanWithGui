currently script is only for 15.5 with esapiessnetials 2.0
have to include esapiessentials and esapiessentials.pluginrunner directly in project
modify esapiessentials.pluginrunner/application/pluginrunner.cs in runScript->
            finally
            {
                _esapiApp.SaveModifications();
                _esapiApp.ClosePatient();
            }


Bugs:
When running run oncology script, messanger does not update messages until scipt ends running. use event aggregator to fix this?
