currently script is only for 15.5 with esapiessnetials 2.0
have to include esapiessentials and esapiessentials.pluginrunner directly in project
modify esapiessentials.pluginrunner/application/pluginrunner.cs in runScript->
            finally
            {
                _esapiApp.SaveModifications();
                _esapiApp.ClosePatient();
            }



work in progress... all instructions going to be updated soon.

things to do:
fix bug with gui interface, where re-opening module doesn't work correctly
make modules customizable with configuration files to avoid hard coding
